## Environmental exposures, development, and microglia

Since joining the Bilbo lab in the fall semester of 2019, I have had the opportunity to collaborate on several
projects in the lab investigating the intersection between environmental exposures and development, with a
special focus on how microglia translate early-life challenges to later life changes in brain and behavior. The
first experiments I was involved with in the lab were with a postdoc (Dr. Alexis Ceasrine) where we found that
maternal high-fat diet induces inflammation-dependent, sex-specific behavioral abnormalities in offspring. In
males, maternal high fat diet decreased sucrose preference, which was caused by over-engulfment of
serotonin neurons by microglia in development and could be rescued with serotonin supplementation. This
project has culminated in a paper now available on BioRxiv, with revisions in response to reviewer
comments from Nature in-progress<sup>1</sup>. As a follow-up to that project, I also helped with analysis of single cell
RNA-sequencing data of isolated microglia and hofbauer cells (placental macrophages) which demonstrated
shared origins and transcriptional programs between these two cell types in development<sup>2</sup>. I have also
contributed to a more recent preprint where we found that combined exposure to air pollution and maternal
stress in utero causes social deficits in male offspring only. I worked with the postdoc on that project (Dr.
Caroline Smith) to analyze bulk RNA-sequencing data from isolated microglia. We found that environmental
exposures cause major transcriptional changes in male microglia only, and that microglia following exposure
have transcriptional similarities with microglia from germ-free mice. I also helped with DREADD manipulations
of dopamine neurons which rescued the social behavior deficits<sup>3</sup>. While working on these projects I became
increasingly interested in microglia and social behavior. Thus, in 2021 I wrote and published a first-author
review paper<sup>4</sup>, where I integrated literature documenting sickness-induced changes in social behaviors across
species.

## Investigating the role of IL34 signaling on mouse brain and behavior.

In my second semester after joining the lab, I became increasingly interested in how neurons and microglia
communicate with one another in development. This led me to the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor
signaling pathway on microglia. This receptor is expressed on all macrophages in the body, but has a
secondary ligand in the brain, that is expressed primarily by neurons (interleukin-34). Existing literature
suggested that microglia depend on IL34 signaling in adulthood, but not embryonically, and little was known
about when IL34 signaling became relevant in the brain. With my interest in development, I performed a qPCR
time course experiment that demonstrated that IL34 expression increases between postnatal day 7 and 15 in
mice, a time frame in development when microglia are interacting extensively with neurons across the brain. In
collaboration with the lab of Dr. Danny Saban here at Duke, I obtained mice lacking functional IL34 protein and
showed that the microglia in those mice have decreased expression of microglial maturity marker TMEM119,
and these mice display deficits in ultrasonic vocalizations. I have presented these findings at both local and
national conferences over the past 2 years<sup>1,2,3,4</sup>.

## Investigating the cortical basis of sensory association in autism

In my undergraduate research experiences, I worked in two labs at the University of Pittsburgh over the
summer, and a joint lab at Allegheny College. In the summer after my junior year, I applied for a research fund
to facilitate an independent research opportunity in the lab of Dr. Caroline Runyan at Pitt. While there, I worked
directly with Dr. Runyan and a new graduate student to train mice on virtual reality behavioral tasks designed
to test sensory association (i.e pair a sound with a visual shape). I performed headplate and craniotomy
surgeries to image parvalbumin+ interneurons using two-photon calcium imaging while the mice performed the
virtual reality behavioral tasks<sup>1</sup>. I integrated this interest in PV+ interneurons and sensory association with my
interest in brain development for my senior thesis research in the lab of Dr. Jeffrey Hollerman. In this project, I
found that prenatal exposure to an environmental toxicant (valproic acid) does not influence sensory
association ability but decreases the number of PV+ interneurons in adult male rats<sup>2</sup>.
