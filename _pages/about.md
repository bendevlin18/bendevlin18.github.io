About Me
====
I am interested in studying how glia interact with neurons in development and how these interactions
contribute to both early and later-life disease. In the long term, it is my goal to establish an independent
research program that allows me to tackle these questions while continuing to teach the next generation of
scientists. My first exposure to neuroscience was as an undergraduate in the lab of Dr. Jeffrey Cross and Dr.
Jeffrey Hollerman at Allegheny College. As an independent study student, and eventually a senior thesis
student, I learned techniques relevant to systems neuroscience and became interested in the role that glia play
in developmental disorders. Outside of my home university, I spent two summers in labs at the University of
Pittsburgh where I studied mitochondrial encephalomyopathies in fruit flies and inhibitory interneurons in mice.
For my graduate training, I decided that I wanted to pursue a program and lab that emphasized glia-neuron
interactions in the context of neurodevelopment. This diversity of experiences led me to confidently and
enthusiastically choose Dr. Staci Bilbo’s lab at Duke University. Dr. Bilbo’s use of cutting-edge
neuroscience and immunology techniques compliments my excitement for microglia and neurodevelopment.
Furthermore, Dr. Bilbo has a long track record of positive graduate and postdoctoral mentorship, which was
important to me as a prospective trainee. Since I started in her lab in 2019, I have had the privilege of
contributing to a first-author review paper, a paper published in Molecular Neurobiology1, and 3 pre-prints (all
available on BioRxiv) which have provided me with the tools and expertise to study microglia in the developing
brain. Throughout these experiences, I have refined my interests and identified gaps in the literature that have
led to my own research project.

For my thesis project, I have proposed to study the role of a neuron-derived cytokine interleukin-34 (IL34)
on microglia development and function. IL34 is an alternate ligand for the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor
(CSF1r) on microglia. Signaling through this receptor is responsible for the proliferation and differentiation of
macrophages in the body (and microglia in the brain). While there was literature detailing the role of IL34 in
adult mice, I noticed that little work had been done to elucidate the significance of IL34 signaling in early
postnatal development; a period characterized by extensive microglia-neuron interactions. In my preliminary
experiments, I have found that IL34 peak expression coincides with a period of synapse formation and pruning
in the anterior cingulate cortex, and that loss of IL34 prevents the developmental upregulation of microglial
“maturity” marker TMEM119. My predoctoral studies aim to test whether IL34 expression is dependent on
neuronal activity during a period of synapse formation in the developing cortex and if IL34 prevents overpruning
of synapses by microglia. With the support of my primary mentor Dr. Bilbo, and my co-sponsors at
Duke, I am excited to complete this work and gain the professional skills vital for me to achieve my goal of
becoming an independent scientist.
