I personally believe that getting students excited about class topics is critical to their engagement and eventual learning of the material. Thus, *it is imperative to establish a level of enthusiasm in my students that is tangible, and extends beyond the classroom, since I believe this is essential to their engagement, acquisition, and future use of the material*. Moreover, I believe that if students are truly interested in the topics being discussed, they will be more likely to remember and use the material covered in class in their future endeavors. Finally, I strive to provide an inclusive, comfortable, and encouraging environment for students to learn and share ideas.
